Zaptel auto detection module for freepbx
----------------------------------------

This module is capable of detecting most Zaptel hardware by a single click
on the WEB interface. The code has a WEB interface, as well as a console 
only script. 


You need to install sudo on the machine, as have the following lines 
in /etc/sudoers :

Debian/Ubuntu:
    asterisk ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/share/freepbx-common/detect_zap

Trixbox/Centos/Fedora:
    asterisk ALL=NOPASSWD:/var/lib/asterisk/bin/detect_zap

These lines are set up by the post install of the RPM/DEB packages,
so usually you don't need to deal with this. In rare cases
in which the lines are missing, please add them manually using the "visudo" 
command.

Note that the official RPMs for Trixbox/Centos/Fedora do not contain 
genzaptelconf and that the version of genzaptelconf found in Trixbox 
(/usr/local/sbin/genzaptelconf) is not suitable for this utility. Use 
/usr/sbin/genzaptelconf from Zaptel.

This version is should work in FreePBX 2.1.X, 2.2.X, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6.
Only versions 2.5 and 2.6 are tested, all others are completely not tested.
If you find a problem, please contact us.

How it works
------------
The hardware detection is splited into 4 logical levels

1) genzaptelconf/dahdi_genconf will generate /etc/zaptel.conf or /etc/dahdi/system.conf
   and also make /etc/asterisk/zapata-auto.conf (or zapata-channels.conf on some
   systems), or dahdi-channels* in new systems. with FXO/BRI/PRI channels only. 
   This stage stops asterisk, generates the FXO definitions as well as the zaptel.conf|system.conf 
   needed to properly configure the devices using ztcfg/dahdi_cfg.
   
2) zap2amp will generate the settings for FXS channels (based on what is 
   found on /etc/zapata.conf,/etc/dahdi/system.conf) from a template 
   (/var/lib/asterisk/bin/zap.template) and upload then into the sql 
   tables, so you can see the FXS stations as normal extensions on 
   FreePBX (you can put them into ring groups, have them as the default 
   station in incomming calls, etc).

3.a) The retrieve scripts are called. Asterisk configuration are created. 
3.b) Asterisk is restarted with the new Zaptel/DAHDI configuration.

The reason for these stages, is because on Zapata/DAHDI HW removal, the 
configuration will be so messed up that asterisk will fail to load and 
freePBX will be completely non functional. This situation is fixed with 
Asterisk 1.4 (in which case asterisk will load without zap channels).

4) fix_ast_db will connect to the Asterisk manager, and create the 
   apropiate astdb entries for dialparties. It will also create the 
   links in the voicemail needed by freePBX to properly work.
