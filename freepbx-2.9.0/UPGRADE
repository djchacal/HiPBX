Upgrading FreePBX

Upgrading FreePBX is easy.  You should perform these steps on a running system.  There should be no impact to service.


Upgrading from the FreePBX-version.tar.gz download from sourceforge:

- save the FreePBX-version.tar.gz to /usr/src/
- cd /usr/src/ :: change to your /usr/src directory
- rm -rf FreePBX :: remove your current FreePBX directory (if you have one)
- tar -zxvf FreePBX-version.tar.gz :: extract the new FreePBX tar
- cd FreePBX-version :: change to the FreePBX directory
- ./install_amp :: run the install script

- ./AAH_updatemaint.sh (optional)
  This is used to restore the maintenance tab that is not part of AMP or FreePBX.
