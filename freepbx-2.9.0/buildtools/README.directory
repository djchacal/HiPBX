Build Tools:

This directory contains tools that are used to build and package FreePBX.
This document will describe the tools available, what they do and how you
use them.

WARNING: Some of these tools will do direct svn checkin's and should be used
         with caution. Please review the scripts before doing a publish
         and make sure they do no need to be updated. At this time they do
         very little error checking and should evolve to improve over time.

pack_javascripts.php:

This script is used to package the libfreebx.javascripts.js by taking
all the javascript libraries that are used under the common directory and
running them through the jsmin class included with pack_javascripts.php. 


/--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
generate-release.sh

This script automates most of the process of generating the release tarballs and
associated tags to do a release. It is outlined on the wiki and the key stages
are listed here (from the wiki):

 * Now run the "generate-release.sh <version-number>" script which will:
   * package and checking libfreepbx.javascripts.js if needed
   * generate the md5 hash for the new version and commit it
   * create a tag from the current branch
   * svn cp the core and framework modules into ~amp_conf/htdocs/admin/modules of the tag
   * creates and cd to /usr/src/freepbx-release directory
   * svn exports the tag to create a normal freepbx-''<version-number>''.tar.gz
   * uses the modlist.sh list to export all the modules and creates a freepbx-''<version-number>''-withmodules.tar.gz 

/--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
md5-amp_conf.sh

This script is not really used any longer as the functionality is incorporated into
generate-release.sh. It's purpose is to generate the md5 sum files. It does not checkin
files to svn.
